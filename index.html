    <h2>ACM/IFIP Midd4DT 2023</h2>
    <p>
        Nowadays, the concept of Digital Twin (DT) is used in a wide variety of domains
        such as manufacturing, healthcare, smart cities, smart agriculture, smart grids,
        and mechanical engineering, to enhance the performance, enable proactive
        maintenance to extend the physical system’s life, enhanced productivity, and
        faster innovation with reduced costs.
        Typically, the digital twin systems are generated and then synchronized using
        data flows in both directions between the
        real-world physical components and their virtual replica counterparts.
        Furthermore, a digital twin can enable continuous prototyping, and testing
        on-demand, without interruption, assuring and self-optimizing the forthcoming 5G
        network and beyond. It creates virtual replicas of IoT devices in various
        application scenarios and maintains a device twin for every connected device.

        <br>
        Furthermore, Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) middleware, service-oriented
        middleware, and many other middleware
        modernization approaches are providing a Virtual Automation Bus (VAB) to offer
        end-to-end connectivity between physical
        assets and the digital twin through many heterogeneous communication protocols,
        brokers, and messaging services, while
        ensuring interoperability among heterogeneous protocols and facilitating
        cross-layer interaction with the digital twin through VAB. Besides,

    <!--  <h2>Camera-ready Instructions</h2>
    <h3>LaTeX Instructions</h3>
    <p>
    <h4>Template:</h4> Please use the sigconf proceedings template from the ACM Master article template for LaTeX (acmart class) for
    your submission (under the LaTeX Authors section). Please follow the instructions given on the page, and please have a
    look / start from the sample file “sample-sigconf.tex” in the acmart package. Even if you have already downloaded the
    package for another conference, you should download it again as ACM often makes changes to their template and publishes
    new versions. If you submit a paper using an outdated version of the template, you might be required to update to a
    newer version.</p>
    <p>
    <h4>Fonts:</h4>     Type 1 or TrueType fonts must be used (this will usually happen by default). Type 3 fonts are not permitted.
    TrueType fonts are permitted, but will be tested for any problems which may need to be rectified. For help on obtaining
    the correct type of fonts, see this hint in the ACM FAQ list. Note: in rare cases, PDFs generated with pdflatex will not
    contain embedded fonts. This most often occurs when vector images included in paper do not themselves embed their fonts.
    If we find problems with your PDF, and you are unable to submit a revised version with correctly embedded fonts, we may
    have to take a less desirable and less safe route: that you submit a PostScript (PS) version, from which we produce PDF.
    </p>
    <p>
    <h4>Camera-ready copyright header: </h4>
    the ACM copyright form will provide a block of LaTeX code to be included in the “Rights
    management information” section of the header. Please double-check that your produced document matches the copyright
    info details found in HotCrp, and that you have included your full DOI URL.
